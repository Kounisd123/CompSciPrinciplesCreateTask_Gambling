# CompSciPrinciplesCreateTask_Gambling
For AP Computer Science Principles Exam, there is a create task option. This create task can be a group project and
my friend and I are going to be working on it. Since it'll mostly, if not all, be coded in python. We decided to upload and work on it on here in the meantime. It's just for fun and no actual gambling is involved. Everything uploaded won't always be complete so make suer to check back freqeuntly for updates.
